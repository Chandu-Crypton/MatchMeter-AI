AI Tools Used
Deep Seek - for component templates, and debugging help

How I Structured Prompts
I used simple, focused prompts like:
-> Implement better math logic
-> Fix this error
-> Style this component with Tailwind CSS

AI-Assisted vs Human Written
Component Structure: AI provided initial component templates, but I wrote all the props, state management logic, and component interactions.

TypeScript Types: AI suggested basic interfaces, but I created the final type definitions and ensured proper type safety throughout.

CSS Styling: AI suggested Tailwind utility classes, but I handled all layout decisions, responsive design, and visual polish.

Analysis Logic: Initially I wrote the basic math and then used AI for better implementation.

Bug Fixes: AI helped explain error messages, but I implemented all the actual fixes and solutions.

In short: AI helped with boilerplate and suggestions, but all critical logic, architecture decisions, and final implementation are mine.
